I am a Ph.D. candidate a under the supervision of [Prof. Chunyi Peng](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/chunyi/) in Computer Science at Purdue University.
My research interests are in the interdisciplinary field of mobile computing and computer vision, with a foucs on building efficient mobile vision system. 
Recently, I am working on autonomous and connected drones.

Before joining Purdue, I received my master and bachalor degree in 2019 and 2017 from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), respectively.
