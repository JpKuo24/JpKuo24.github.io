My research aims to build an efficient mobile vision system with edge-assisted live video analytics.
I am interested in exploiting and developing a multi-disciplinary solution that incorporates computer vision, edge computing multimedia and machine leanring to to enhance the system's effectiveness and efficiency. 

Currently, I am particular interested in the following problems:
* Making mobile vision more efficient with more video compression
* Enhance DNN deployment efficiency in diverse use sceaniro


Compress Video without Compromising Analytical Accuracy

Customize DNN Deployment in Diverse Use Scenario

When presented with diverse mobile devices performing distinct application tasks that facilitate varying scenarios, the question arises: How can we tailor DNN to enhance performance for each scenario?

In this project, we

    <p>Instead of training a specialized DNN for each deployment scenario, we have developed a
novel approach of using the shallow subnet to test the water. The effectiveness of using a
shallow subnet to accelerate the search of a deep subnet has been validated effective in image
classification, one showcase application.</p>
